# Getting Started

1. [FizzBuzz](/katas/FizzBuzz.md)
   This is basically the "hello world" of katas. It's pretty simple and should help you make sure you have your test environment set up properly and that you get the basic process, without being too challenging technically.
2. [String Calculator](<katas/String%20Calculator.md>)
   String Calculator is a fairly simple and straightforward problem that you should do in a 30 minute timebox. Don't expect to complete it in this time. You should plan on doing it again after a week or so between attempts and see if you get further with successive attempts.
3. [Greed](katas/Greed.md)
   This exercise has a number of different approaches you can apply, and should give you some experience that can help with later exercises.
4. [Gilded Rose (refactoring kata)](katas/Gilded%20Rose.md)
   This kata is designed to help you learn to test and refactor existing code.
5. [Builder in Unit Tests (C#)](https://github.com/ercindedeoglu/BuilderTestSample)
   This kata is designed to teach you how to use the builder to minimize extensive setup code needed in real world tests.
6. [File Logger (mocking kata)](katas/File%20Logger.md)
   This kata is designed to teach you why mocks are valuable, by creating a problem that is difficult to solve without them. Be sure to complete the entire kata, since only going through the first half will miss this point.
